Allows you to set a max discount for percentage discount coupon.

== Description ==

When creating or editing a discount code, you'll see a new field called 'Maximum discount allowed.' Simply enter the maximum discount that a customer is allowed to get off of their purchase.  For example, let's say you sell a plugin and offer many different licenses.  You have a lifetime license that you sell for $800.  You also have a single site annual license that you sell for $100.  While it makes sense to provide a 50% discount on the $100 license, it doesn't always make sense to allow that same code to be used on the $800 license.  You don't want to give your customer $400 off.  So, set your Maximum discount allowed field to $50.  Now, the single site license will only cost $50.  The lifetime license will cost $750 instead of $400.
